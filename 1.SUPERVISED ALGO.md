# SUPERVISED LEARNING :
- teaching a computer how to do something by showing it examples
- Model learn from labeled data 
	Ex: email spam detection —spam mail or not 
- Steps :
	1. DATA COLLECTION - system will be given a labeled data
	2. TRAINING	- using some algorithms 
	3. TESTING - test with new data and check whether model is validating or not

## Supervised : 
1. Classification goal
2. Regression goal

## CLASSIFICATION GOAL : 
assign input data to predefined classes
### Algorithms :
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Logistic regression
- Decision trees
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks 
### Example : 
email spam detection  – email is spam or not spam 
	
## REGRESSION GOAL :
predict a numerical value based on input features 
### Algorithms : 
- Linear regression
- Polynomial regression
- Regression trees 
### Example : 
housing price model – based on house size decide price of the house
